## [Project 2: GuessTheFlag](https://github.com/tiannahenrylewis/100DaysOfSwiftUI/tree/master/GuessTheFlag) :white_check_mark:  
A simple guessing game built as a single view app. The User is presented with 3 flags at random and a prompt to select a countries flag from the 3 available flags shown. Once the user has made their selection an alert is presented onscreen notifying the user if their selection was correct or not with a custom message depending on the outcome. If the user is correct, they are awarded a point, but if they are wrong they lose a point, as long as they have at least 1 point to lose.

**Key Topics:** Stacks, Gradients, Buttons, Alerts, Modifiers, State
